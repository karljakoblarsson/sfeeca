### 2019-01-22 "Start of project"
This is not the official start date, but I will start working a bit.

### 2019-01-31 Deadline planning report
This is preliminary and not to be included in the actual planning report.

### 2019-02-07 Deadline prev. literature study
I should have found, read and categorized most of the related literature
avalible.
<!-- TODO Vague goal. This is impossible to complete. -->

### 2019-02-01 Decsision about main assment method.

### 2019-02-13 Current implementation assesment.
I should have read, tested and tinkered with the current implementation of
FEECa. I should understand most of it before I start my implementation.
<!-- TODO Vague goal. This is hard to assess.. -->

### 2019-02-18 First implementation draft.
I should have a project with some code that runs. Not much more is needed at
this stage. At least some plan for the implementation.

### 2019-03-01 Half-time report submission

### 2019-03-05 Half-time presentation


### 2019-03-30 Implementation deadline
I should have the code almost complete. Enough code to be able to write the
final report and submit. I will probably work more on it if I feel. But
I should not have to do that to pass the thesis.

### 2019-04-15 Testing deadline
Similar to above. I should have done all the testing I nedd for submission.
Probably not all I will do, but I should have enough for submission.
